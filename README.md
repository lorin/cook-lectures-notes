# Notes on Dr. Richard Cook's lectures on the study of cognitive work

My personal, unofficial, incomplete notes based on watching Dr. Richard Cook's [lectures on the study of cognitive work](https://vimeo.com/showcase/6184024).

The seventh lecture is not in the collection, but it can be found on Vimeo at https://vimeo.com/95514812. It is a guest lecture by [Professor Jeffrey Braithwaite](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/our-people/our-people-chris/professor-jeffrey-braithwaite).

All references are just my best guesses from the context of the videos.

### Lecture 1: 

Cognitive work studies around safety/human performance draw from Three Mile Island:
* studies of people in simulators
* work studies
* incident reporting studies
* accident investigation studies

Joke in human factors: Until 1979, there were only two kinds of subjects that got any attention from human factors people:
1. Someone died who shouldn't have (aircraft/transport systems)
2. Someone didn't die who should have. (weapons system failure)

Researchers who studied Three Mile Island:
* Jens Rasmussen 
* Morten Lind
* David Woods
* John Senders
* Neville Moray
* James Reason
* Charles Perrow


Existing theories about safety didn't explain how it was that the TMI operators could have been confused about what was actually happening in the plant.

The idea that human error was *the cause* because itself something that needed to be studied, and generated a whole series of new researches/quests/examinations on the topic of error itself

The operators believed they were doing the right thing, but had an incorrect model of the plant.

People were upset by TMI b/c there seem to have been multiple opportunities for people to have gotten the right diagnosis.

* goal conflicts

### Lecture 3: Bootstrapping, artifacts, and Tokaimura

* fundamental surprise (impossible accident, black swan)
* flexible, dynamic world of work
* safety experts are good at post-hoc analysis, but can't predict where the next accident will happen
* risks of doing cognitive task analysis:
  - getting bogged down in the details of the domain
  - going too narrow
* best way to get inside a domain is to look at the cognitive artifacts
* cognitive artifacts show the state of the world that matters to the operator
* if operator is creating cognitive artifacts during high tempo activities, a researcher can use the cognitive artifact to identify what the operator identifies as most important to pay attention to in the moment
* cognitive artifacts act as a map for researcher
* distributed cognition: sharing cognitive artifacts
  - shared representation of the world
  - surfaces mismatches between different operators' understanding of the world
* bootstrapping: 
  - cognitive task analysis has to be done iteratively
  - going back and forth between person's view of the world and what's actually going on in the world
